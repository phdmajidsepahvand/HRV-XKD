# HRV-XKD

The official repository of HRV-XKD: A Cross-Window Attention-Based Knowledge Distillation Framework for Early Hypertension Detection via Temporal Drift Analysis in ECG-Derived HRV.

# 

### Overview

Early detection of hypertension is challenging due to the gradual and subtle nature of neurocardiac dysregulation. Traditional Heart Rate Variability (HRV)-based methods often rely on static, single-window analyses and fail to capture temporal dynamics across multiple windows.

In this project, we propose HRV-XKD, a cross-window attention-based knowledge distillation framework designed to model gradual temporal drifts in HRV signals for accurate early hypertension detection. The framework was evaluated using two publicly available datasets: PPG-BP and MIMIC-IV Waveform. Raw biosignals were preprocessed to extract HRV features and segmented into overlapping windows to better capture temporal variations.

The proposed approach employs a high-capacity teacher network to model temporal dependencies using multi-head cross-window attention, while transferring its learned knowledge into a lightweight student model through a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy, temperature-scaled soft-target alignment, and feature mimicry. The resulting student model is optimized for real-time deployment on wearable devices.

Experimental results demonstrate that HRV-XKD outperforms classical baselines and recent deep learning models, including ExHyptNet. On the MIMIC-IV dataset, the student model achieved an AUC of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.89, while reducing model complexity by over 65% and improving inference speed by 3.2Ã—. Comparable results on the PPG-BP dataset confirm the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework.

Overall, HRV-XKD provides an accurate, explainable, and computationally efficient solution for early hypertension screening, bridging the gap between high-performance AI and resource-constrained deployment in real-world healthcare applications.
