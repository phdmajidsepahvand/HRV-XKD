##### \# HRV-XKD

# 

The official repository of \*\*HRV-XKD\*\*: Early Hypertension Detection via Temporal Drift Analysis in ECG-Derived HRV: A Cross-Window Attention-Based Knowledge Distillation Framework.

# 

##### \## 📚 Overview

This project proposes an innovative approach to \*\*Early Hypertension Detection\*\* by analyzing the \*\*Temporal Drift\*\* in \*\*ECG-derived HRV\*\* signals. The model leverages a \*\*Cross-Window Attention-Based Knowledge Distillation Framework\*\* for accurate prediction of hypertension onset.

# 

\## 🚀 Features

\- \*\*Data Preprocessing\*\*: Data loading and preprocessing from the MIMIC-III database.

\- \*\*Modeling\*\*: Implementation of a \*\*Cross-Window Attention Model\*\* for classification.

\- \*\*Knowledge Distillation\*\*: Using a teacher-student approach for enhanced performance.

\- \*\*Evaluation\*\*: Metrics such as \*\*Accuracy\*\* and \*\*F1-Score\*\* to evaluate model performance.
